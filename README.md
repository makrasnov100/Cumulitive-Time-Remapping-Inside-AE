# Cumulitive-Time-Remapping-Inside-AE
The following expression code allows you to speed up/slow down footage based on the amplitude of a music track inside Adobe After Effect.

## How to use:
    1. Generate an Audio Amplitude layer from your sound clip (music)
    2. Right click on the video layer to which you want to apply this effect
    3. Select the "time remap" option from the shown context menu
    4. Alt+click on stopwatch in the time remap effect properties
    5. Apply the expression code in the text file

Clamp version allows to limit minimum and maximum speed of video playback (effect may become less noticeble)

## How is this different from regular time remap based on amplitude
The code allows you to change video speed with sound in Adobe Ater Efects without having the time remap effect think it has to reverse the video when there is a lower volume.
